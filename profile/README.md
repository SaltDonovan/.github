# 🎮 Welcome

We build games and the AI that powers them.

## Projects

### 🔥 [GameOne](https://github.com/maxschommer/GameOne)

A satirical multiplayer prediction market manipulation game. 4-8 players compete to accumulate wealth through insider trading, spreading fake news, and market manipulation—while an AI-driven "Senate" of 100 neural-network NPCs tries to outsmart them.

**Stack:** C# · MonoGame · LiteNetLib
